    <h2>Ingredients Needed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2.5 pounds of potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup of vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>
        <li>1 teapsoon of salt</li>
        <li>half a cup of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Step-by-Step</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
        <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
